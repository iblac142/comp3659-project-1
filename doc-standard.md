Each function should have a block comment with three components:
  1. Concisely describe the purpose of the function
  2. List and describe each of the arguments
  3. Describe the possible return values

Inline comments are to be used when:
* The precise function or purpose of a piece of code is not immediately apparent
* It is helpful in letting a human reader understand the current state of the program
* The coder believes it to be otherwise helpful
